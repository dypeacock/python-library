Difficulties :

1. reformatting and debugging functions so that they work with the GUI.
2. implementing matplotlib graphs into GUI. Specifically being unable to use bar charts, 
   and being unable to use grid_forget() for the graphs
3. bookSelect file : coming up with technicalities behind the reccomendation
   function.
4. time management : allotting equal amounts of time to coursework and other
   modules.

Things I am proud of :

1. overall functionality of GUI
2. problem-solving and finding solutions to logistical issues in my 
   checkout and return functions - particularly the reservation aspect.
